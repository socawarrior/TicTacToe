# TicTacToe
My first python program using functions. 

Its a simple Tic Tac Toe game that allows two people to play together on the same computer using the num pad as the board and can be run through the command prompt.
The program will accept player 1 and player 2 input (1-9 on the numpad) and will display and update the Tic Tac Toe board. It will only accept 1-9 for the input, and will
run for 9 round unless one player gets three in a row (vertical, across, or diagna). There is a (Y/N) option to continue playing at the end of the 9 rounds or if someone wins.

I hope to build on this and create a desktop application with a nice user interface. I appreciate any advice or suggestions on how to improve the code. Thanks!
